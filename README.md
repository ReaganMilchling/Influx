# Influx
A simple work in progress game made with javafx. 
I first built this game in high school in processing after inspiration from a youtube video series. 
The structure now is similar to the youtube tutorial, but most of this game is now originally coded by me.
I have been using different libraries as a means of keeping my ideas and implementation original.
